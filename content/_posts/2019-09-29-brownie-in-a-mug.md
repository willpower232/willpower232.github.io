# Brownie in a mug

First mix together the dry ingredients in your mug of choice
- 50grams sugar
- 30grams flour
- pinch of salt
- 2tablespoons cocoa _(not hot chocolate, which is just more sugar)_

Make a well in the middle and add 2 tablespoons of oil and 2 tablespoons of water.

Mix to a paste consistency, might need more water, but don't add too much.

Microwave for 2 or 3 minutes at full power.

## Experimentation

Depending on the size of your mug, you might prefer to multiply the ingredients by 1.5 or even 2 (if you're a sports direct customer).

If you want something a bit gooier, you could try using 80% or 60% power on your microwave.
