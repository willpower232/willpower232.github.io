# Roast

Using the broke ass gourmet endorsed method of cooking the chicken at full blast for 50 minutes, start the chicken.

Put butter under the skin and some herbs inside and outside.

Then start boiling water whilst you peel some potatoes. Bigger potatoes the better.

Boil the potatoes for 10 minutes and put the veg tray in the oven with some oil whilst you prepare carrots, sweet potatoes, onion whatever.

Prepare some stuffing (leave for 5 minutes if you can)

Put the stuffing with the chicken and all the veg in.
