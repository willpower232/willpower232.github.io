Initially I attempted to follow [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze7MyUrDNKs) but my minecraft crashed in this configuration so I had to do something less well integrated. Fortunately I stumbled into [antimicro](https://github.com/AntiMicro/antimicro) which seems to fit the job perfectly.

I am using the following configuration with my Xbox One controller

- Left stick - WASD for movement
- Right stick - mouse up/down/left/right for looking
- Left trigger - right click for placing blocks
- Right trigger - left click for breaking blocks
- Left bumper - mouse 4 (wheel up) for scrolling left through hotbar
- Right bumper - mouse 5 (wheel down) for scrolling right through hotbar

I also needed to lower the vertical notch count for the bumpers so that the scrolling through items was more controllable, it was 20 by default but 5-10 should suffice.

- D pad up - F3 for debug (to see current coordinates)
- D pad left - F to swap item to left hand
- D pad down - left shift for sneaking
- D pad right - _unused_
- Right stick click - _unused_
- Left stick click - _unused_

I don't need to sneak really but that is uncomfortable to hold so might change that in the future. I had it on a stick press as a toggle at one point however the controls glitched out and I drowned trying to get into a boat.

- Guide - ESC for menu
- Start - ESC for menu
- Back - ESC for menu

These are all the same but I don't have a need for them all to be different.

- A - space to jump
- B - Q for drop item
- X - E for inventory
- Y - left ctrl for sprinting

I also still have a keyboard and mouse available so that I can do chat, commands, or search for things to craft but having a controller (and auto jump) means I can navigate the world more comfortably. I also inverted the mouse because that is how I roll.
