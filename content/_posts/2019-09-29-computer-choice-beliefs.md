# Computer Choice Beliefs

My entire use of computers is governed by two inescapable facts.

1. your computer will be restarted at some point, whether by choice or accident
2. you will reinstall your operating system or move to a new computer at some point, whether by choice or failure

This means that:
- I make sure I can get from fresh boot to carrying on work as quickly as possible (i.e. Mac Spotlight, using the super key)
- I stay as close to out of the box configuration as possible, any complicated settings or setup to be scripted or backed up
